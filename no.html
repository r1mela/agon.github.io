				<h3>truth is, this isn’t your actual gift anyway. I just wanted to at least do smth to remind you of your home, your peace, and my love for you. The effort I put into this was minimal, but I tried to make it meaningful. You see, you and I, there is no one who can love each other more than we love each other. However, we are more than that, we are each others home. And just like I long to rest on your chest, I know you long for the same peace. I can’t be there right now to hug you, kiss you, nor cuddle you. But if you go back to press yes, you’ll see an animation of a heart. The heart is beating 1.08 times per 1 second, or 1 beat per 0.92 second. That is my average resting heart rate, and I hope it serves as a reminder that there are only 3 weeks left until you get to feel my heart beat against your body again. I can’t physically cuddle you, you can’t physically feel my heart, but I’m here, my heart is here for you and you will never be alone as long as I live and breath. Happy Birthday my love, take my heart and be with me for a lifetime ❤️</h3>
